            <dl>
                <dt>Test Series</dt>
                <dd>We provide you the best test series for Class XI, XII, JEE, NEET chapterwise which will be scheduled for whole year. This test series follows very logical sequence of Basic → Advance questions.</dd>
                <dt>DPP</dt>
                <dd>Daily Practice is the key to success. Hence we are now providing lecturewise DPP sheets for Class XI Alpha Physics. The best questions of this sheet would be also discussed in the later video lecture.</dd>
                <dt>Assignment</dt>
                <dd>Now, this is something you won't get for free so easily. These Assignment are best in industry and follow a very logical sequence of Basic→Advance questions.The cherry on top is that at the end of Assignment you get solution too detailed. The Assignment are designed keeping in my mind the syllabus of CBSE as well as JEE Main/ NEET/ JEE Advance.</dd>
